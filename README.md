# ![](src/main/resources/static/favicon-32x32.png) Kandinsky Reimagined


I thought of this project when I visited an exhibition of Kandinsky's work and life in Shanghai. His masterpieces like Yellow-Red-Blue, Composition series, and Improvisation series, along with his idea of synesthesia revealed a new world to me. I know Kandinsky might hear Richard Wagner in these works,but I know my interpretation is different. I want others to be able to hear my synesthesia. Therefore I designed this program.
